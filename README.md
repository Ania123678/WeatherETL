# ETL pipeline for weather app
## Introduction:
The website showcases the up-to-date weather data in a user-friendly format.
The ETL pipeline enables the extraction, transformation, and loading of weather data for the app. Users can access accurate and timely weather information through the simple web interface.

## The ETL pipeline in the weather app repository consists of the following components:
- Web Scraping script: A module to extract weather information from a specific website. It collects and processes the relevant data points.
  
- DAG Management with Airflow:A file that manages task scheduling and dependencies using Airflow. It ensures the ETL process runs smoothly.
  
- Webpage using Flask and Bootstrap:
Built with Flask, a Python web framework, and Bootstrap for a clean interface. It displays the weather information retrieved from the web scraping module.

- Test using pytest
